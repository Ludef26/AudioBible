# THE AUDIO BIBLE

## What is an Audio Bible?

An audio bible is the set of music, sound effects and voices within a video game, with it we can better recreate the world we have created around it and make the player believe it more.

For example in "Dark Souls" there is a dark theme throughout his world and of course in his Audio Bible. All the soundtracks and sound effects are designed to put you in that universe.
